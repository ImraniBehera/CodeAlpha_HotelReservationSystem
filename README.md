A Hotel Reservation System is a software application or platform designed to allow hotels or hospitality businesses to manage room bookings and reservations. The system enables both guests and hotel administrators to handle room availability, pricing, booking confirmations, and payment processing efficiently. It can be integrated into the hotel's website or mobile app to allow guests to make reservations online or managed internally for front desk operations.

Key features:
1)Room Booking and Availability Management
The system allows guests to search for available rooms based on criteria like check-in/check-out dates, room types (single, double, suite), and number of guests.Hotel administrators can manage room availability, ensuring that rooms are not double-booked and are ready for guests upon their arrival.
2) Online Reservations
Guests can make online reservations through the hotel's website or mobile app. They can select their desired room, view pricing, and confirm their booking.
The system generates a confirmation for the guest and updates the room availability automatically.
3)Pricing and Rate Management
The system allows the hotel to set room rates based on various factors such as seasonality, room type, or promotions.Dynamic pricing models can also be integrated, where prices adjust automatically based on demand or other external factors.
